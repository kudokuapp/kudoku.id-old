### Hello Kudos! How’s your day going? 😁

Ga kerasa udah 2 mingguan kami belum kasih another update dari progress Kudoku. Yup, things got sooo hectic in our team. So here’s some updates! 🔥

### Updates

-   **We’re finished implementing third-party connectivity** which enables us to gather transactions data across financial accounts such as bank, e-wallet, investment, and also marketplace! Dengan kata lain: by the time Kudoku app launch, seluruh Kudos sudah bisa mendapatkan data-data dari financial account kalian secara otomatis 🤩
-   Creating is personal to us. That’s why we put a lot of attention on building Kudoku app. We want to maximize your experience when using our app. And proudly say, **we just finished our transaction tracking feature 🎉**
-   On the next several days, **we will randomly choose some Kudos** to test our transaction tracking feature design! For the selected Kudos, feel free to give us as many feedback as you can 😉

That’s all the updates!

Feel free to reach me out at rizqy@kudoku.id and also my co-founders (furqon@kudoku.id and aldi@kudoku.id) if you have questions about Kudoku.

Rizqy,

Co-founder of Kudoku
